            <p>Earlier this morning, at approximately 9:30 am, Junior the turtle got out of the water to <em>bask</em> on his basking rock. I know, it doesn't sound real, but I promise it happened.</p>
            <p>The table below depicts his actions at each timestamp for more detail.</p>

            <table>

                    <td>9:29am</td>
                    <td>Junior began to bask.</td>

                </tbody>

            <p>Junior's typical day consists of:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Swimming</li>
                <li>Hiding in plants</li>
                <li>Eating</li>
                <li>Knocking over his plants for better hiding spots</li>
            </ul>

            <p>However, he has disliked basking because he is still nervous in his tank. But now, basking could be in his future! Junior's future is bright.</p>
            <p>Do you think Junior will keep basking? Comment below.</p>
