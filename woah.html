                <p>Earlier this morning, at approximately 9:30 am, Junior the turtle got out of the water to <em>bask</em> on his basking rock. I know, it doesn't sound real, but I promise it happened.</p>
                <p>The table below depicts his actions at each timestamp for more detail.</p>
    
                <table>
                    <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Time</th>
                        <th>Action</th>
                    </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td>8:55am</td>
                        <td>Junior approached the basking rock.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>8:57am</td>
                        <td>Junior appeared to change his mind and swam away.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>9:15am</td>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>9:25am</td>
                        <td>Junior climbed the steps to poke his head out of the water.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>9:29am</td>
                        <td>Junior began to bask.</td>
                    </tr>
                    </tbody>
                </table><br>
    
                <p id="underlinedP">Junior's typical day consists of:</p>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>Swimming</li>
                    <li>Hiding in plants</li>
                    <li>Eating</li>
                    <li>Knocking over his plants for better hiding spots</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>However, he has disliked basking because he is still nervous in his tank. But now, basking could be in his future! Junior's future is bright.</p>
